Keeping this cargo meant death&mdash;to
jettison it meant to make flotsam
and jetsam of a world!</div>

<p><b>Illustrated by MARTIN</b></p></div>


<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Ciriimian ship was
passing in hyperdrive
through a classic three-body
system, comprising in this
case a fiercely white sun circled
by a fainter companion and a
single planet that swung in precise
balance, when the Canthorian
Zid broke out of its cage in the
specimen hold.</p>

<p>Of the ship's social quartet,
Chafis One and Two were asleep
at the moment, dreaming wistful
dreams of conical Ciriimian cities
spearing up to a soft and plum-colored
sky. The Zid raged into
their communal rest cell, smashed
them down from their gimbaled
sleeping perches and, with the
ravening blood-hunger of its kind,
devoured them before they could
wake enough to teleport to
safety.</p>

<p>Chafis Three and Four, on psi
shift in the forward control cubicle,
might have fallen as easily
if the mental screamings of their
fellows had not warned them in
time. As it was, they had barely
time to teleport themselves to
the after hold, as far as possible
from immediate danger, and to consider
the issue while the Zid
lunged about the ship in search
of them with malignant cries
and a great shrieking of claws on
metal.</p>

<p>Their case was the more desperate
because the Chafis were professional
freighters with little experience
of emergency. Hauling a
Zid from Canthorian jungles to
a Ciriimian zoo was a prosaic
enough assignment so long as the
cage held, but with the raging
brute swiftly smelling them out,
they were helpless to catch and
restrain it.</p>

<p>When the Zid found them, they
had no other course but to teleport
back to the control cubicle
and wait until the beast should
snuff them down again. The Zid
learned quickly, so quickly that
it was soon clear that its physical
strength would far outlast their
considerable but limited telekinetic
ability.</p>

<p>Still they possessed their share
of owlish Ciriimian logic and hit
soon enough upon the one practical course&mdash;to
jettison the Zid
on the nearest world demonstrably
free of intelligent life.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> worked hurriedly, between
jumps fore and aft.
Chafi Three, while they were still
in the control cubicle, threw the
ship out of hyperdrive within
scant miles of the neighboring
sun's single planet. Chafi Four,
on the next jump, scanned the
ship's charts and identified the
system through which they
traveled.</p>

<p>Luck was with them. The system
had been catalogued some
four Ciriimian generations before
and tagged: <i>Planet undeveloped.
Tranquil marine intelligences
only.</i></p>

<p>The discovery relieved them
greatly for the reason that no
Ciriimian, even to save his own
feathered skin, would have set
down such a monster as the Zid
among rational but vulnerable
entities.</p>

<p>The planet was a water world,
bare of continents and only
sparsely sprinkled with minor
archipelagoes. The islands suited
the Chafis' purpose admirably.</p>

<p>"The Zid does not swim," Chafi
Four radiated. "Marooned, it can
do no harm to marine intelligences."</p>

<p>"Also," Chafi Three pointed out
as they dodged to the control
cubicle again just ahead of the
slavering Zid, "we may return
later with a Canthorian hunting
party and recover our investment."</p>

<p>Closing their perception against
the Zid's distracting ragings, they
set to work with perfect coordination.</p>

<p>Chafi Three set down the ship
on an island that was only one
of a freckling chain of similar
islands. Chafi Four projected himself
first to the opened port; then,
when the Zid charged after him,
to the herbivore-cropped sward
of tropical setting outside.</p>

<p>The Zid lunged out. Chafi Four
teleported inside again. Chafi
Three closed the port. Together
they relaxed their perception
shields in relief&mdash;</p>

<p>Unaware in their consternation
that they committed the barbarous
lapse of vocalizing, they
twittered aloud when they realized
the extent of their error.</p>

<p>Above the far, murmurous
whisper of expected marine cerebration
there rose an uncoordinated
mishmash of thought from
at least two strong and relatively
complex intelligences.</p>

<p>"Gas-breathing!" Chafi Four
said unbelievingly. "Warm-blooded,
land-dwelling, mammalian!"</p>

<p>"A Class Five culture," Chafi
agreed shakenly. His aura quivered
with the shock of betrayal.
"The catalogue was <i>wrong</i>."</p>

<p>Ironically, their problem was
more pressing now than before.
Unless checked, the Zid would
rapidly depopulate the island&mdash;and,
to check it, they must break
a prime rule of Galactic protocol
in asking the help of a new and
untested species.</p>

<p>But they had no choice. They
teleported at once into the presence
of the two nearby natives&mdash;and
met with frustration beyond
Ciriimian experience.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jeff</span> Aubray glimpsed the Ciriimian
ship's landing because
the morning was a Oneday, and
on Onedays his mission to the
island demanded that he be up
and about at sunrise.</p>

<p>For two reasons: On Onedays,
through some unfailing miracle
of Calaxian seamanship, old
Charlie Mack sailed down in his
ancient <i>Island Queen</i> from the
township that represented colonial
Terran civilization in Procynian
Archipelago 147, bringing
supplies and gossip to last Jeff
through the following Tenday.
The <i>Queen</i> would dock at Jeff's
little pier at dawn; she was never
late.</p>

<p>Also on Onedays, necessarily
before Charlie Mack's visit, Jeff
must assemble his smuggled communicator&mdash;kept
dismantled and
hidden from suspicious local eyes&mdash;and
report to Earth Interests
Consulate his progress during the
cycle just ended. The ungodly
hour of transmission, naturally,
was set to coincide with the closing
of the Consul's field office
halfway around the planet.</p>

<p>So the nacreous glory of Procyon's
rising was just tinting the
windows of Jeff's cottage when
he aligned and activated his little
communicator on his breakfast
table. Its three-inch screen lighted
to signal and a dour and disappointed
Consul Satterfield looked
at him. Behind Satterfield, foreshortened
to gnomishness by the
pickup, lurked Dr. Hermann,
Earth Interests' resident zoologist.</p>

<p>"No progress," Jeff reported,
"except that the few islanders
I've met seem to be accepting
me at last. A little more time and
they might let me into the Township,
where I can learn something.
If Homeside&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've had seven Tendays,"
Satterfield said. "Homeside won't
wait longer, Aubray. They need
those calm-crystals too badly."</p>

<p>"They'll use force?" Jeff had
considered the possibility, but its
immediacy appalled him. "Sir,
these colonists had been autonomous
for over two hundred years,
ever since the Fourth War cut
them off from us. Will Homeside
deny their independence?"</p>

<p>His sense of loss at Satterfield's
grim nod stemmed from something
deeper than sympathy for
the islanders. It found roots in
his daily rambles over the little
island granted him by the Township
for the painting he had begun
as a blind to his assignment,
and in the gossip of old Charlie
Mack and the few others he had
met. He had learned to appreciate
the easy life of the islands
well enough to be dismayed now
by what must happen under EI
pressure to old Charlie and his
handful of sun-browned fisherfolk.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Unexpectedly</span>, because
Jeff had not considered that
it might matter, he was disturbed
by the realization that he wouldn't
be seeing Jennifer, old Charlie
Mack's red-haired niece, once occupation
began. Jennifer, who
sailed with her uncle and did a
crewman's work as a matter of
course, would despise the sight
of him.</p>

<p>The Consul's pessimism jolted
Jeff back to the moment at hand.</p>

<p>"Homeside will deny their
autonomy, Aubray. I've had a
warp-beam message today ordering
me to move in."</p>

<p>The situation was desperate
enough at home, Jeff had to admit.
Calaxian calm-crystals did
what no refinement of Terran
therapeutics had been able to
manage. They erased the fears
of the neurotic and calmed the
quiverings of the hypertensive&mdash;both
in alarming majority in the
shattering aftermath of the Fourth
War&mdash;with no adverse effects
at all. Permanent benefit was slow
but cumulative, offering for the
first time a real step toward ultimate
stability. The medical, psychiatric
and political fields cried
out for crystals and more crystals.</p>

<p>"If the islanders would tell us
their source and let us help develop
it," Satterfield said peevishly,
"instead of doling out a handful
of crystals every Tenday, there
wouldn't be any need of action.
Homeside feels they're just letting
us have some of the surplus."</p>

<p>"Not likely," Jeff said. "They
don't use the crystals themselves."</p>

<p>Old Dr. Hermann put his chin
almost on the Consul's shoulder
to present his wizened face to
the scanner.</p>

<p>"Of course they don't," he said.
"On an uncomplicated, even
simple-minded world like this,
who would need crystals? But
maybe they fear glutting the
market or the domination of outside
capital coming in to develop
the source. When people backslide,
there's no telling what's on
their minds and we have no time
to waste negotiating or convincing
them. In any case, how could
they stop us from moving in?"
Abruptly he switched to his own
interest. "Aubray, have you
learned anything new about the
Scoops?"</p>

<p>"Nothing beyond the fact that
the islanders don't talk about
them," Jeff said. "I've seen perhaps
a dozen offshore during the
seven cycles I've been here. One
usually surfaces outside my harbor
at about the time old Charlie
Mack's supply boat comes in."</p>

<p>Thinking of Charlie Mack
brought a forced end to his report.
"Charlie's due now. I'll call
back later."</p>

<p>He cut the circuit, hurrying
to have his communicator stowed
away before old Charlie's arrival&mdash;not,
he thought bitterly, that
being found out now would make
any great difference.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Stepping</span> out into the brief
Calaxian dawn, he caught his
glimpse of the Ciriimian ship's
landing before the island forest
of palm-ferns cut it off from sight.
Homeside hadn't been bluffing,
he thought, assuming as a matter
of course that this was the task
force Satterfield had been ordered
to send.</p>

<p>"They didn't waste any time,"
Jeff growled. "Damn them."</p>

<p>He ignored the inevitable glory
of morning rainbow that just preceded
Procyon's rising and strode
irritably down to his miniature
dock. He was still scowling over
what he should tell Charlie Mack
when the <i>Island Queen</i> hove into
view.</p>

<p>She was a pretty sight. There
was an artist's perception in Jeff
in spite of his drab years of EI
patrol duty; the white puff of
sail on dark-green sea, gliding
across calm water banded with
lighter and darker striae where
submerged shoals lay, struck
something responsive in him. The
comparison it forced between
Calaxia and Earth, whose yawning
Fourth War scars and heritage of
anxieties made calm-crystals so
desperately necessary, oppressed
him. Calaxia was wholly unscarred,
her people without need of the
calm-crystals they traded.</p>

<p>Something odd in the set of the
<i>Queen's</i> sails puzzled him until
he identified the abnormality. In
spite of distance and the swift
approach of the old fishing boat,
he could have sworn that her
sails bellied not with the wind,
but against.</p>

<p>They fell slack, however, when
the <i>Queen</i> reached his channel
and flapped lazily, reversing to
catch the wind and nose her cautiously
into the shallows. Jeff dismissed
it impatiently&mdash;a change
of wind or some crafty maneuver
of old Charlie Mack's to take advantage
of the current.</p>

<p>Jeff had just set foot on his
dock when it happened. Solid as
the planking itself, and all but
blocking off his view of the nearing
<i>Island Queen</i>, stood a six-foot
owl.</p>

<p>It was wingless and covered
smoothly with pastel-blue feathers.
It stood solidly on carefully
manicured yellow feet and stared
at him out of square violet eyes.</p>

<p>Involuntarily he took a backward
step, caught his heel on a
sun-warped board and sat down
heavily.</p>

<p>"Well, what the devil!" he said
inanely.</p>

<p>The owl winced and disappeared
without a sound.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jeff</span> got up shakily and stumbled
to the dock's edge. A chill
conviction of insanity gripped him
when he looked down on water
lapping smooth and undisturbed
below.</p>

<p>"I've gone mad," he said aloud.</p>

<p>Out on the bay, another catastrophe
just as improbable was
in progress.</p>

<p>Old Charlie Mack's <i>Island
Queen</i> had veered sharply off
course, left the darker-green stripe
of safe channel and plunged into
water too shallow for her draft.
The boat heeled on shoal sand,
listed and hung aground with
wind-filled sails holding her fast.</p>

<p>The Scoop that had surfaced
just behind her was so close that
Jeff wondered if its species' legendary
good nature had been misrepresented.
It floated like a
glistening plum-colored island,
flat dorsal flippers undulating
gently on the water and its great
filmy eyes all but closed against
the slanting glare of morning sun.</p>

<p>It was more than vast. The
thing must weigh, Jeff thought
dizzily, thousands or maybe millions
of tons.</p>

<p>He thought he understood the
<i>Queen's</i> grounding when he saw
the swimmer stroking urgently
toward his dock. Old Charlie had
abandoned his boat and was
swimming in to escape the Scoop.</p>

<p>But it wasn't Charlie. It was
Jennifer, Charlie's niece.</p>

<p>Jeff took the brown hand she
put up and drew her to the dock
beside her, steadying her while
she shook out her dripping red
hair and regained her breath.
Sea water had plastered Jennifer's
white blouse and knee-length
dungarees to her body like a second skin,
and the effect bordered
on the spectacular.</p>

<p>"Did you see it?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Jeff wrestled his eyes away to
the Scoop that floated like a
purple island in the bay.</p>

<p>"A proper monster," he said.
"You got out just in time."</p>

<p>She looked at once startled
and impatient. "Not the Scoop,
you idiot. The owl."</p>

<p>It was Jeff's turn to stare.
"Owl? There was one on the
dock, but I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So did I." She sounded relieved.
"But if you saw one, too....
All of a sudden, it was standing
there on deck beside me, right
out of nowhere. I lost my head
and grounded the <i>Queen</i>, and it
vanished. The owl, I mean."</p>

<p>"So did mine," Jeff said.</p>

<p>While they stood marveling,
the owls came back.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Chafis</span> Three and Four were
horribly shaken by the initial
attempt at communication with
the natives. Nothing in Ciriimian
experience had prepared them for
creatures intelligent but illogical,
individually perceptive yet isolated
from each other.</p>

<p>"Communication by audible
symbol," Chafi Three said. He
ruffled his feathers in a shudder.
"Barbarous!"</p>

<p>"Atavistic," agreed Chafi Four.
"They could even <i>lie</i> to each
other."</p>

<p>But their dilemma remained.
They must warn the natives before
the prowling Zid found them,
else there would be no natives.</p>

<p>"We must try again," Three
concluded, "searching out and
using the proper symbols for explanation."</p>

<p>"Vocally," said Chafi Four.</p>

<p>They shuddered and teleported.</p>

<hr style='width: 20%;' />

<p><span class="dcap">The sudden</span> reappearance of
his hallucination&mdash;doubled&mdash;startled
Jeff no more than the
fact that he seemed to be holding
Jennifer Mack tightly. Amazingly,
his immediate problem was
not the possibility of harm from
the owls, but whether he should
reassure Jennifer before or after
releasing her.</p>

<p>He compromised by leaving the
choice to her. "They can't be
dangerous," he said. "There are
no land-dwelling predators on
Calaxia. I read that in&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">
<img src="images/001.png" width="425" height="550" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Nothing like <i>that</i> ever hatched
out on Calaxia," said Jennifer. She
pulled free of him. "If they're real,
they came from somewhere else."</p>

<p>The implication drew a cold
finger down Jeff's spine. "That
would mean other cultures out
here. And in all our years of
planet-hunting, we haven't found
one."</p>

<p>Memory chilled him further.</p>

<p>"A ship landed inland a few
minutes ago," he said. "I took it
for an EI consulate craft, but it
could have been&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Ciriimians caught his mental
image of the landing and
intervened while common ground
offered.</p>

<p>"The ship was ours," said Chafi
Three. He had not vocalized since
fledgling days and his voice had
a jarring croak of disuse. "Our
Zid escaped its cage and destroyed
two of us, forcing us to
maroon it here for our own safety.
Unfortunately, we trusted our star
manual's statement that the
planet is unpopulated."</p>

<p>The Terrans drew together
again.</p>

<p>"Zid?" Jeff echoed.</p>

<p>Chafi Four relieved his fellow
of the strain by trying his own
rusty croak. "A vicious Canthorian
predator, combing the island
at this moment for prey. You
must help us to recapture it."</p>

<p>"So that you may identify it,"
Chafi Three finished helpfully,
"the Zid has this appearance."</p>

<p>His psi projection of the Zid
appeared on the dock before
them with demoniac abruptness&mdash;crouched
to leap, twin tails
lashing and its ten-foot length
bristling with glassy magenta
bristles. It had a lethal pair of
extra limbs that sprang from the
shoulders to end in taloned seizing-hands,
and its slanted red eyes
burned malevolently from a
snouted, razor-fanged face.</p>

<p>It was too real to bear. Jeff
stepped back on suddenly unreliable
legs. Jennifer fainted
against him and the unexpected
weight of her sent them both
sprawling to the dock.</p>

<p>"We lean on weak reeds," Chafi
Three said. "Creatures who collapse
with terror at the mere
projection of a Zid can be of
little assistance in recapturing
one."</p>

<p>Chafi Four agreed reluctantly.
"Then we must seek aid elsewhere."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> Jeff Aubray pulled
himself up from the planking,
the apparitions were gone.
His knees shook and perspiration
crawled cold on his face, but he
managed to haul Jennifer up with
him.</p>

<p>"Come out of it, will you?" he
yelled ungallantly in her ear. "If
a thing like that is loose on the
island, we've got to get help!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jennifer</span> did not respond and
he slapped her, until her eyes
fluttered angrily.</p>

<p>"There's an EI communicator
in my cabin," Jeff said. "Let's
go."</p>

<p>Memory lent Jennifer a sudden
vitality that nearly left Jeff behind
in their dash for the cottage
up the beach.</p>

<p>"The door," Jeff panted, inside.
"Fasten the hurricane bolt.
Hurry."</p>

<p>While she secured the flimsy
door, he ripped through his belongings,
aligning his EI communicator
again on his breakfast
table. Finding out where the
islanders got their calm-crystals
had become suddenly unimportant;
just then, he wanted nothing
so much as to see a well-armed
patrol ship nosing down out of
the Calaxian sunrise.</p>

<p>He was activating the screen
when Jennifer, in a magnificent
rage in spite of soaked blouse
and dungarees, advanced on him.</p>

<p>"You're an Earth Interests spy
after all," she accused. "They said
in the Township you are no artist,
but Uncle Charlie and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jeff made a pushing motion.
"Keep away from me. Do you
want that devil tearing the cabin
down around us?"</p>

<p>She fell quiet, remembering
the Zid, and he made his call.
"Aubray, Chain 147. Come in,
Consulate!"</p>

<p>There was a sound of stealthy
movement outside the cabin and
he flicked sweat out of his eyes
with a hand that shook.</p>

<p>"EI, for God's sake, come in!
I'm in trouble here!"</p>

<p>The image on his three-inch
screen was not Consul Satterfield's
but the startled consulate
operator's. "Trouble?"</p>

<p>Jeff forced stumbling words
into line. The EI operator shook
his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Consul's gone for the day,
Aubray. I'll see if I can reach
him."</p>

<p>"He was about to send out an
EI patrol ship to take over here
in the islands," Jeff said. "Tell
him to hurry it!"</p>

<p>He knew when he put down
the microphone that the ship
would be too late. EI might still
drag the secret of the calm-crystal
source out of the islanders, but
Jeff Aubray and Jennifer Mack
wouldn't be on hand to witness
their sorry triumph. The flimsy
cabin could not stand for long
against the sort of brute the owls
had shown him, and there was no
sort of weapon at hand. They
couldn't even run.</p>

<p>"There's something outside,"
Jennifer said in a small voice.</p>

<p>Her voice seemed to trigger
the attack.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Zid lunged against the
door with a force that cracked
the wooden hurricane bolt across
and opened a three-inch slit between
leading edge and lintel. Jeff
had a glimpse of slanted red eyes
and white-fanged snout before
reflex sent him headlong to
shoulder the door shut again.</p>

<p>"The bunk," he panted at Jennifer.
"Shove it over."</p>

<p>Between them, they wedged
the bunk against the door and
held it in place. Then they stood
looking palely at each other and
waiting for the next attack.</p>

<p>It came from a different quarter&mdash;the
wide double windows
that overlooked the bay. The Zid,
rearing upright, smashed away
the flimsy rattan blinds with a
taloned seizing-hand and looked
redly in at them.</p>

<p>Like a man in a dream, Jeff
caught up his communicator from
the table and hurled it. The Zid
caught it deftly, sank glistening
teeth into the unit and demolished
it with a single snap.</p>

<p>Crushed, the rig's powerful
little battery discharged with a
muffled sputtering and flashing
of sparks. The Zid howled piercingly
and dropped away from the
window.</p>

<p>That gave Jeff time enough to
reach the storm shutters and secure them&mdash;only
to rush again
with Jennifer to their bunk barricade
as the Zid promptly renewed
its ferocious attack on the door.</p>

<p>He flinched when Jennifer, to
be heard above the Zid's ragings,
shouted in his ear: "My Scoop
should have the <i>Queen</i> afloat by
now. Can we reach her?"</p>

<p>"Scoop?" The Zid's avid cries
discouraged curiosity before it
was well born. "We'd never make
it. We couldn't possibly outrun
that beast."</p>

<p>The Zid crashed against the
door and drove it inches ajar,
driving back their barricade. One
taloned paw slid in and slashed
viciously at random. Jeff ducked
and strained his weight against
the bunk, momentarily pinning
the Zid's threshing forelimb.</p>

<p>Chafi Three chose that moment
to reappear, nearly causing Jeff
to let go the bunk and admit the
Zid.</p>

<p>"Your female's suggestion is
right," the Ciriimian croaked. "The
Zid does not swim. Four and I
are arranging escape on that
premise."</p>

<p>The Zid's talons ripped through
the door, leaving parallel rows
of splintered breaks. Both slanted
red eyes glared in briefly.</p>

<p>"Then you'd damn well better
hurry," Jeff panted. The door,
he estimated, might&mdash;or might
not&mdash;hold for two minutes more.</p>

<p>The Ciriimian vanished. There
was a slithering sound in the distance
that sounded like a mountain
in motion, and with it a stertorous
grunting that all but
drowned out the Zid's cries. Something
nudged the cottage with a
force that all but knocked it flat.</p>

<p>"<i>My Scoop!</i>" Jennifer exclaimed.
She let go the barricade
and ran to the window to throw
open the storm shutters. "Never
mind the door. This way, quick!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> scrambled to the window
sill and jumped. Numbly, Jeff
saw her suspended there, feet
only inches below the sill, apparently
on empty air. Then the door
sagged again under the Zid's lungings
and he left the bunk to
follow Jennifer.</p>

<p>He landed on something tough
and warm and slippery, a monstrous
tail fluke that stretched
down the beach to merge into a
flat purplish acreage of back,
forested with endless rows of fins
and spines and enigmatic tendrils.
The Scoop, he saw, and only
half believed it, had wallowed
into the shallows alongside his
dock. It had reversed its unbelievable
length to keep the head submerged,
and at the same time had
backed out of the water until its
leviathan tail spanned the hundred-odd
yards of sloping beach
from surf to cabin.</p>

<p>Just ahead of him, Jennifer
caught an erect fin-spine and
clung with both arms. "Hang on!
We're going&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Scoop contracted itself
with a suddenness that yanked
them yards from the cottage and
all but dislodged Jeff. Beyond the
surf, the shallows boiled whitely
where the Scoop fought for traction
to draw its grounded bulk
into the water.</p>

<p>Jeff looked back once to see
the Zid close the distance between
and spring upward to the
tail fluke behind him. He had an
instant conviction that the brute's
second spring would see him torn
to bits, but the Scoop at the moment
found water deep enough
to move in earnest. The Zid could
only sink in all six taloned limbs
and hold fast.</p>

<p>The hundred-odd yards from
cabin to beach passed in a blur
of speed. The Scoop reached
deeper water and submerged,
throwing a mountainous billow
that sent the <i>Island Queen</i> reeling
and all but foundered her.</p>

<p>Jeff was dislodged instantly
and sank like a stone.</p>

<p>He came up, spouting water
and fighting for breath, to find
himself a perilous twenty feet
from the Zid. The Zid, utterly
out of its element, screamed hideously
and threshed water to froth,
all its earlier ferocity vanished
under the imminent and unfamiliar
threat of drowning. Jeff
sank again and churned desperately
to put distance between
them.</p>

<p>He came up again, nearly
strangled, to find that either he
or the Zid had halved the distance
between them. They were
all but eye to eye when Jennifer
caught him and towed him away
toward the doubtful safety of the
<i>Island Queen</i>.</p>

<p>Chafis Three and Four appeared
from nowhere and stood
solemnly by while the Zid weakened
and sank with a final gout
of bubbles.</p>

<p>"We must have your friend's
help," Chafi Three said to Jennifer
then, "to recover our investment."</p>

<p>Jeff wheeled on him incredulously.
"<i>Me</i> go down there after
that monster? Not on your&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He means the Scoop," Jennifer
said. "They brought it
ashore to help us out of the cabin.
Why shouldn't it help them
now?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> Scoop came up out of the
water so smoothly that the
<i>Island Queen</i> hardly rocked, dangling
the limp form of the Zid
from its great rubbery lips like a
drowned kitten.</p>

<p>"Here," Jennifer said.</p>

<p>The Scoop touched its vast
face to the <i>Queen's</i> rail and
dropped the unconscious body to
the deck. The Zid twitched weakly
and coughed up froth and
water.</p>

<p>Jeff backed away warily.
"Damn it, are we going through
all that again? Once it gets its
wind back&mdash;"</p>

<p>Chafi Three interrupted him
this time. "The crystal now. We
must have it to quiet the Zid
until it is safely caged again."</p>

<p>Jennifer turned suddenly firm.
"No. I won't let this EI informer
know about that."</p>

<p>The Ciriimians were firmer.</p>

<p>"It will not matter now. Galactic
Adjustment will extend aid to
both Calaxia and Terra, furnishing
substitutes for the crystals
you deal in. There will be no loss
to either faction."</p>

<p>"No loss?" Jennifer repeated
indignantly. "But then there won't
be any demand for our crystals!
We'll lose everything we've
gained."</p>

<p>"Not so," Chafi Three assured
her. "Galactic will offer satisfactory
items in exchange, as well
as a solution to Terra's problems."</p>

<p>The Scoop, sensing Jennifer's
surrender, slid its ponderous bulk
nearer and opened its mouth,
leaving half an acre of lower jaw
resting flush with the <i>Island
Queen's</i> deck. Without hesitation,
Jennifer stepped over the rail and
vanished into the yawning pinkish
cavern beyond.</p>

<p>Appalled, Jeff rushed after her.
"Jennifer! Have you lost your
mind?"</p>

<p>"There is no danger," Chafi
Three assured him. "Scoops are
benevolent as well as intelligent,
and arrived long ago at a working
agreement with the islanders.
This one has produced a crystal
and is ready to be relieved of it,
else it would not have attached
itself to a convenient human."</p>

<p>Jeff said dizzily, "The Scoops
make the crystals?"</p>

<p>"There is a nidus just back of
a fleshy process in its throat,
corresponding to your own tonsils,
which produces a crystal
much as your Terran oyster secretes
a pearl. The irritation distracts
the Scoops from their meditations&mdash;they
are a philosophical
species, though not mechanically
progressive&mdash;and prompts them
to barter their strength for a
time to be rid of it."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Jennifer</span> reappeared with a
walnut-sized crystal in her
hand and vaulted across the rail.</p>

<p>"There goes another Scoop," she
said resignedly. "The <i>Queen</i> will
have to tack with the wind for a
while until another one shows up."</p>

<p>"So that's why your sails bellied
backward when you came in to
harbor," said Jeff. "The thing was
<i>towing</i> you."</p>

<p>A thin, high streak of vapor-trail
needling down toward them
from the sunrise rainbow turned
the channel of his thought.</p>

<p>"That will be Satterfield and
his task force," Jeff told the
Chafis. "I think you're going to
find yourselves in an argument
over that matter of squeezing
Terra out of the crystal trade."</p>

<p>They reassured him solemnly.</p>

<p>"Terra has no real need of the
crystals. We can offer a tested
genetics program that will eliminate
racial anxiety within a few
generations, and supply neural
therapy equipment&mdash;on a trade
basis, of course&mdash;that will serve
the crystals' purpose during the
interim."</p>

<p>There should be a flaw somewhere,
Jeff felt, but he failed to
see one. He gave up trying when
he found Jennifer eying him with
uncharacteristic uncertainty.</p>

<p>"You'll be glad to get back to
your patrol work," she said. It had
an oddly tentative sound.</p>

<p>Somehow the predictable monotony
of consulate work had
never seemed less inviting. The
prospect of ending his Calaxian
tour and going back to a half-barren
and jittery Earth appealed
to Jeff even less.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "I'd like to stay."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to do but fish
and sail around looking for Scoops
ready to shed their crystals,"
Jennifer reminded him. "Still,
Uncle Charlie has talked about
settling in the Township and
standing for Council election. Can
you fish and sail, Jeff Aubray?"</p>

<p>The consulate rocket landed
ashore, but Jeff ignored it.</p>

<p>"I can learn," he said.</p>
